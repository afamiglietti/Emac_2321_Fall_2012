Attention failure modes to cover in class: 

### Worlds colliding
- Your social and professional worlds get entangled 
- A real danger to using facebook as groupware
- Solve by maintaining seperate "spaces" for work and play 

### Trying to read the whole internet
- (screenshot of waaay too many tabs open)
- Driven by the anxiety of missing something
- Use a buffer to store potentially useful resources for later review
- Set limits
  - The programmer's serenty prayer 

### Task anxiety avoidance
- Freaking out and distracting yourself to avoid having a panic attack because you can't solve a problem in the current task
- Mindfulness, and even brief meditation can help
- Choose distractions wisely (wash dishes, work out, go for a walk).

### Wikipedia link-drift syndrome 
- The classic XKCD
- Hyper-text documents use links to create non-linear organization systems. This makes them both powerful and dangerous. 
- Be mindful of your task. Store links you can't read right now in your buffer.
