### EMAC 2321 Writing and Research For New Media

### Spring 2012

### Syllabus Website

#### Course Description

Digital media play an extremely important role in contemporary writing
and research techniques. In fact, it would not be inaccurate to say that
all writing and research are now digital! However, the platforms and
technologies that make up digital media are constantly changing and
shifting. Anyone who only learns writing and research techniques tied
too closely to a single platform is likely to find that these skills
rapidly go out of date. This course, *Writing and Research for New
Media*, seeks to avoid this pitfall by helping students learn broad,
transferable skills that will help them use current platforms
successfully, and adapt to new platforms as they emerge. As such, this
course stresses the *process*of learning over rote memorization!
Students are expected to experiment with techniques, and learn to be
comfortable exploring new platforms and tools.

This syllabus website is the best way for students to keep up to date
with course readings, policies and assignments. See the links below for
more information. A [pdf version of this
syllabus](http://copyvillain.org/ATEC_2321_MATERIALS/EMAC_2321_Spring_2012_Syllabus.pdf)
is available for those who wish a print copy for reading convenience or
record keeping. However, you should be aware that the print version will
not be updated as regularly as the syllabus website! If the print
version and website version of the syllabus disagree *the web version is
correct.*

All students must fill out the [group blog
questionnaire](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?hl=en_US&formkey=dGE0SUxBRDZEVHBTMlN2SmQ1djBoS3c6MQ#gid=0)
before the end of the day on Friday, January 20! Students who donâ€™t
complete a questionnaire will be assigned a group and role at random!
