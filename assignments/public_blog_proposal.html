<p>Before beginning work on the <a href="http://copyvillain.org/blog/2321-public-blog-assignment/">public blog project</a> students must complete a short proposal, explaining their desired blog topic and listing some preliminary resources the student will draw on as examples and sources as they start writing.</p>
<p>Students will complete many of the pieces of the blog proposal as homework assignments during the first weeks of class. The final proposal simply asks you to collect these pieces, along with some new work, and submit them to the instructor via elearning for feedback.</p>
<h3 id="blog-concept-paragraph">Blog concept paragraph</h3>
<p>Write a single paragraph (150-200 words) explaining what you want to blog about and why. Review the &quot;blog topic&quot; section of the <a href="http://copyvillain.org/blog/2321-public-blog-assignment/">public blog assignment</a> before beginning. When you first draft this paragraph, at beginning of week 2, you will likely be just beginning to think about your blog community. That's ok. By the time you turn in the final draft of your proposal, however, you should be sure to have selected a specific topic within a well-established blog community.</p>
<p>Your concept paragraph should answer the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>What will your blog be about?</li>
<li>Who do you expect to read your blog?</li>
<li>How will you distinguish yourself from other bloggers working on similar topics?</li>
<li>Why will readers choose to read your blog, as opposed to another source of information?</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="annotated-twitter-list">Annotated twitter list</h3>
<p>During week four of class, you will prepare a list of seven twitter sources relevant to your topic. Following good sources on twitter can be a great source of timely information for your blog! For your proposal, include your list of seven twitter sources, along with a brief explanation of what makes each source valuable. For example, if you were proposing a blog on popular science and wanted to include Phil Plait as a twitter source, you might write:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Phil Plait</strong>(@BadAstronomer): Phil Plait is a well known and outspoken astronmer and skeptic. He blogs for Discover magazine on science topics.</li>
</ul>
<p>Complete one entry like the one above for <em>each</em> of your seven twitter sources.</p>
<h3 id="annotated-blogroll">Annotated blogroll</h3>
<p>It is vital that you find high-quality blogs in your topic area to use as examples for your blogs, and as sources of information! We'll discuss how to winnow your list down to the highest quality blogs near the end of week four, but to succeed, you should really start looking for blogs to serve as examples much sooner, as soon as you have an idea for a concept. Use the search techniques discussed in three in your search.</p>
<p>For the blog proposal, include a list of five high-quality blogs in your topic area. For each blog, give an explanation of why you think it is a high-quality site and a good example for you to follow. For example, if you were proposing a blog on technology and geek culture, and wanted to use the blog BoingBoing as an example, you might write:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>BoingBoing</strong>(<a href="http://boingboing.net/">http://boingboing.net</a>) BoingBoing is an extremely well known and well regarded technology and geek culture blog. BoingBoing is consistently linked to by other well known, high-quality blogs in the community, including Slashdot, io9, and gizmodo. The blog’s authors include: nationally known science-fiction author and copyright law critic Cory Doctrow, who has published many award winning books with major publishers, and Xeni Jardin, who has a heavily followed and often quoted twitter presence and has been quoted as a source on technology and culture issues by national news organizations including CNN. BoingBoing links to high-quality sources including major news outlets, government documents, and other high-quality blogs. BoingBoing also provides unique and informative commentary on the material they link to. For example, one recent post discussing alleged bad deeds Google committed while dealing with a Kenyan charity not only linked to a reliable story on the case, but also included Cory Doctrow’s analysis of the story in his own words. This analysis showed the reader Doctrow’s expert opinion on the matter. BoingBoing also published updates informing readers of Google’s side of the story.</li>
</ul>
<p>Write an entry like the one above for each of your five example blogs. Be sure to include the blog's name, URL, and a description like the one given in each entry.</p>
