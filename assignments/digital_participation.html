<h3 id="course-collaborative-documents-10">Course Collaborative Documents (10%)</h3>
<p>This course asks students to participate in the production of several <em>collaborative documents,</em> that is to say, to work together with classmates to author and edit a single piece of writing. We will use <em>wiki</em> software (the same software that powers Wikipedia) to allow us to work together on the same document. If this is your first time editing a wiki, you may want to check out the <a href="http://copyvillain.org/emac2321wiki/index.php?title=Basic_Wiki_Editing_Instructions">basic wiki editing instructions</a></p>
<p>Over the course of this class, three collaborative documents will be created. Click through the links below to access the wiki page for each document, which includes a document outline and goals to get you started.</p>

</ul>
<p>Students are expected to participate in all three of these collaborative documents. Your contributions to the wiki will be tracked by the wiki software and reviewed by the instructor! Participation in each document will be evaluated based on the following simple rubric:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Excellent Participation:</strong> The student drafts <em>more than</em> the minimum number of words given in the document description. He or she is a frequent (at least every two weeks) contributor to the process of revising and improving the document, and edits and improves both his or her own work and the work of his or her classmates. He or she is an active participant on the document's talk page, and is able to discuss the document in depth during class. The student's contributions are recognized as valuable by his or her peers, who build on them with their own work.</li>
<li><strong>Good Participation:</strong> The student drafts <em>at least</em> the minimum number of words given in the document description. He or she edits the document multiple times over the course of the semester, and makes at least one meaningful comment on the document's talk page.</li>
<li><strong>Satisfactory Participation:</strong> The student drafts the minimum number of words given in the document description. He or she makes at least one edit to the document, in addition to drafting content.</li>
<li><strong>Unsatisfactory Participation:</strong> The student does not draft the minumum number of words given in the document description, or his or her contributions are off-topic, nonsense, or plagiarized.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="contribute-to-wikipedia-assignment-5">Contribute to Wikipedia Assignment (5%)</h3>
<p>During Week 10 of our class we will discuss mass collaboration online, and especially the pre-eminent example of online collaboration: Wikipedia. Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia anyone can edit (which should not be confused with the <em>wiki</em> software that powers it and our class wiki) is a collection of millions of articles written by thousands of contributors all across the globe. Wikipedia is one of the most visited websites in the world, and many people (maybe even you!) use it as a daily source of information.</p>
<p>This assignment asks students to contribute to <em>one</em> Wikipedia article related to their public blog topic. Any article connected to your topic is acceptable. For example, a political blogger might contribute to an article about a candidate he or she has written about, or a food blogger might contribute to the culture section of an article about a city. Select an article you feel you can make a useful contribution to! Use the sources, knowledge, and experience you have gained in the process of researching and writing your public blog to improve this article. Remember to follow the Wikipedia guidelines for contributors discussed in class on October 31.</p>
<h4 id="contribution-requirements">Contribution requirements</h4>
<p>Your contribution to your selected article must accomplish the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add <em>at least</em> two well-sourced facts, with citations, to the article.</li>
<li>Include necessary connecting language to link your facts to the existing body text of the article.</li>
<li>Make <em>at least</em> three constructive edits to the existing text of the article. Examples of constructive edits include: clarifying unclear language, adding useful links to other wikipedia articles, adding appropriate images (either in the public domain or licensed for re-use of course!), removing inaccurate or biased information, and adding appropriate sources for uncited statements (marked with the &quot;citation needed tag&quot;).</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="contribution-follow-up-and-documentation">Contribution follow-up and documentation</h4>
<p>Visit Wikipedia frequently to check up on your edits and see how they are recieved by the Wikipedia community. If your edits are reverted (removed from the page), try to engage in conversation with the other editors on the talk page before attempting to restore your edits (WARNING: Restoring reverted edits without engaging in conversation first could be construed as <em>edit warring</em> and get you banned from Wikipedia!). Observe how Wikipedia editors build on your additions to the article, and try to assist them if you wish.</p>
<p>To document your contributions to Wikipedia, you will need to submit a link to your Wikipedia user's &quot;contribution log.&quot; To access this, login to your Wikipedia account and click on the link labelled &quot;My Contributions&quot; in the upper right hand corner of the screen.</p>
<p>Copy the web address of this page out of your browser's address bar and paste it into a text document. Add a short (100-200 word) summary of your experience to this document, and submit it to the &quot;Contributing to Wikipedia&quot; assignment on elearning prior to November 27.</p>
<p>You may also reflect in depth about your experience editing Wikipedia for the fourth Reflection Essay, if you are so inspired.</p>
<p>Students who complete all requirements for this assignment will earn full credit. Students who complete some fraction of the requirements will recieve partial credit proportional to how much of the assignment they completed.</p>
<h3 id="attention-journal-network-analysis-assignment-class-bookmark-collection-etc.-10">Attention Journal, Network Analysis Assignment, Class bookmark collection, etc. (10%)</h3>
<p>In addition, there will be a variety of other, small digital participation tasks students will need to complete throughout the course of our class. Cheif amongst these will be the Attention Journal, Network Analysis Assignment, and Class Bookmark Collection, linked to below. However, students should be watchful for other small tasks they may be asked to complete. Successful completion of these tasks will be worth 10% of the student's grade.</p>
