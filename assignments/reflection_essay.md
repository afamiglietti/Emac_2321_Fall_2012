The reflection essay assignment asks students to think carefully about their work in the course, and discuss their experience working on various course assignments. Studies have shown that careful reflection helps students retain lessons and build awareness and skills! Many of the learning experiences in this course will consist of short, in-class or at-home exercises, and the reflection essay gives students a chance to think carefully about these experiences, and better absorb the learning that took place during these exercises. 

Much of the work in this class will be public, but the reflection essay will not. Students will submit reflection essays to the instuctors alone via elearning.

### Essay structure

Essays should focus on what you learned from your experience in class. This can include events that frustrated you, or things you are trying to learn but are still struggling with! However, try to focus on the events and details that influecned your learning, and leave other details aside. 

Your essay should consist of one to three well-structured paragraphs. Remember that a paragraph centers around discussing a single idea. Use your paragraphs to organize your thoughts!

For each reflection essay, a series of questions has been provided below. These questions are designed to get you started, and focus your thinking on learning and class work. *Your essay should NOT be a list of answers to these questions.* Essays that do not directly answer the questions listed, but still provide a clear, detailed discussion of specific learning experiences the student had are acceptable. 


### Reflection Essay One

For reflection essay one (due August 31) consider the following questions: 

- What did you expect this class to teach you when you signed up for it? How have your expectations changed or been confirmed by our initial conversations?
