For each class meeting, the schedule lists what you must complete prior to that meeting, if any under the heading BEFORE CLASS. In most cases, this will be reading, but it will often include short prepatory activities. A brief summary of what to expect during each class meeting (discussion, class activities etc.) is listed under IN CLASS for each class meetings. Finally, small assignments are listed under HOMEWORK, with due dates. Due dates for major assignments are listed in **bold** at the bottom of the listing for the nearest class meeting to the due date.
