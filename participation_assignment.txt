This class seeks to build each student’s understanding of effects of the
new media environment on writing and research practices, and of the key
skills needed to succeed as a writer and researcher in this environment.
Class discussions play an important role in achieving these two goals
because they provide a regular opportunity for students to talk through
the process of connecting information from the class readings to their
individual experiences and skills.

**Instructions:**

Students should come to every class meeting ready to discuss the reading
assigned for the day. To prepare for discussion, carefully read the
assigned material *prior to*the class meeting.

During the class meeting, be prepared to discuss questions asked by the
instructor and respond to ideas introduced by your classmates. Be bold!
Remember, discussion isn’t about being right or showing how clever you
are. Discussion should be an experiment, where everyone can try out
different ideas and see how they work. As long as your contributions to
discussion show that you have done the reading and prepared for our
class meeting, they will be successful!

In addition, there will often be small exercises or in-class activities
during our class meetings. To receive full credit for the class
participation assignment, students must be engaged participants in these
in-class activities.

**Evaluation:\
**Participation is worth 15% of the class grade. You will be assigned
half of the participation grade at mid-semester and half at the end of
the semester. Participation will be evaluated based on the following
rubric.

Excellent Participation

The student is always attentive and alert in class. The student makes
substantial contributions to *every*class discussion. The student’s
contributions always demonstrate that he or she has done the required
reading. The student’s contributions often demonstrate his or her
original thought. The student is an active participant in all in-class
activities, often taking a leadership role in group activities.

Good Participation

The student is always attentive and alert in class. The student makes
substantial contributions to most**class discussions (at least once per
week). The student’s contributions always demonstrate that he or she has
done the required reading. The student plays an active role during
in-class activities.

Satisfactory Participation

The student is usually attentive and alert in class. The student makes
substantial contributions to at least a few**class discussions. The
student’s contributions usually demonstrate that he or she has done the
required reading. The student is sometimes not an active participant
during in-class activities.

Less than Satisfactory Participation

The student is inattentive in class. The student rarely makes
substantial contributions to class discussions. The student’s
contributions strongly suggest he or she has not done the required
reading.
