This class stresses “learning how to learn.” That is to say, gaining the
skills you will need to familiarize yourself to the writing and research
practices new digital platforms demand as these platforms emerge. One of
the most important methods for accomplishing this is the process of
observing and learning from the practices of successful users of a
particular platform.

This assignment asks you to build a list of other blogs writing about
your group blog’s topic. Bloggers sometimes call a list of blogs they
themselves read regularly a “blogroll.” Your blogroll should only
include high quality blogs that you respect and can learn successful
blogging practices from! For each entry on your blog roll, you will need
to complete a short response explaining how you determined that this
blog was a high quality source.

### Instructions:

The process of finding your final annotated blogroll will be somewhat
recursive. That is to say, you will find some initial blogs and use
these initial blogs to lead you to other sources. As you go, you will
evaluate the sources you find for quality, in part by noting the
relationships between the sources themselves.

*Step One:* Find some initial blogs on your topic: First, use the
filtering techniques we discussed in class to find bloggers writing
about your topic (NOTE: If you are writing about a super-specific topic,
like Richardson-area restaurants, it is ok to broaden your search to
include closely related topics). Try to use both search and social media
to start discovering blogs. Follow the links your initial findings
provide (both in posts and in their own blogrolls) to discover other
blogs in the community. During this initial phase, be fairly open-minded
and find as many blogs as you can, but use your common sense to discount
blogs that are obviously very low quality. As you find likely
candidates, add them to your RSS reader so you have an easy way to keep
up with them all.

You should complete this step ASAP, preferably sometime during the third
week of class (feel free to get started sooner, if you feel comfortable
doing so!). Expect to spend a couple of hours completing this task.

*Step Two:* Follow and refine: Check your RSS reader regularly to keep up
with the blogs you discovered during step one. Pay attention to several
things:

-   Which blogs are regularly linked to by others? The best blogs will
    be linked to by others in the community on a regular basis.
-   Which blogs are spoken highly of by other bloggers in the community?
    You will be able to tell a lot about a blog’s reputation by watching
    what others say about them.
-   Which blogs give you a clear idea of the identity and expertise of
    their author or authors? The best blogs will give readers a clear
    sense of who their authors are and why they should trust them. You
    may need to click through to the blog itself, exiting your RSS
    reader, to investigate resources provided by blogs to establish the
    identity of authors, such as “about the author” pages.
-   Which blogs have a professional looking design? You will need to
    click through to the blog itself, exiting your RSS reader, to
    evaluate this. The best blogs will usually have a well maintained
    appearance.
-   Which blogs provide clear, reliable citations for source material?
    The best blogs will provide links to their source material, and the
    source material itself will be high quality.

As you follow your blogs during weeks three and four of class, use the
questions above to evaluate each blog. Refine the list of blogs you are
following on your RSS reader by removing the lowest quality blogs, and
adding new high quality blogs as you find them via links from your
existing list. This process will become a bit recursive, as your list
becomes composed of higher quality blogs, the quality of the blogs your
list links to should also improve, allowing you to find yet more high
quality material.

Start on this step as soon as you complete step one, preferably by the
beginning of week four of class. Expect to check in on your list of
blogs at least two or three times a week during weeks four and five, and
spend at least an hour or so working during each check in.

*Step Three:* Compile your annotated blogroll: Early in week five of
class, compile your annotated blogroll document. Your annotated blogroll
document should list the five highest-quality blogs you discovered
during step two. For each blog listed, write a short (100-200 word)
passage explaining why you believe the blog to be high-quality. Be sure
to discuss the blog’s design, citation practices, reputation in the
blogging community and authors. Be sure to provide *evidence*to support
your claims! For example, if you say that a blog is linked to by other
high-quality blogs, be sure to list the other blogs in question!

Students should complete individual annotated blogrolls. Your groups
will come together to build a combined blogroll after this assignment is
complete. Working independently during this step will help you build
your filtering and crap detection skills, and will give your group a
strong and diverse pool of material to draw from when building a
combined blogroll.

The annotated blogroll must be completed and turned in via the course
elearning site by 11:59pm on February 14! The annotated blogroll should
be submitted in .odt, .rtf, .pdf, or .doc format.

### Sample annotated blogroll entry:

Use the format below for the entries on your annotated blogroll.
Complete one entry for each of the five high-quality blogs you include
in your blogroll.

-   **Blog title**(Blog URL) One hundred to two hundred word explanation
    of why you believe this blog to be a high-quality source. Be sure to
    discuss the blog’s design, citation practices, reputation in the
    blogging community and authors.

For example, an entry about the blog Boing Boing, located at
[http://boingboing.net](http://boingboing.net/) might look like this:

-   **BoingBoing**([http://boingboing.net](http://boingboing.net/))
    BoingBoing is an extremely well known and well regarded technology
    and geek culture blog. BoingBoing is consistently linked to by other
    well known, high-quality blogs in the community, including Slashdot,
    io9, and gizmodo. The blog’s authors include: nationally known
    science-fiction author and copyright law critic Cory Doctrow, who
    has published many award winning books with major publishers, and
    Xeni Jardin, who has a heavily followed and often quoted twitter
    presence and has been quoted as a source on technology and culture
    issues by national news organizations including CNN. BoingBoing
    links to high-quality sources including major news outlets,
    government documents, and other high-quality blogs. BoingBoing also
    provides unique and informative commentary on the material they link
    to. For example, one recent post discussing alleged bad deeds Google
    committed while dealing with a Kenyan charity not only linked to a
    reliable story on the case, but also included Cory Doctrow’s
    analysis of the story in his own words. This analysis showed the
    reader Doctrow’s expert opinion on the matter. BoingBoing also
    published updates informing readers of Google’s side of the story.
    Finally, the design of BoingBoing is very clean and distinct. All
    page elements are carefully aligned. The site uses a combination of
    unique fonts and a black, white and red color scheme to provide a
    unique appearance without being overwhelming.

### Evaluation:

Your annotated blogrolls will be evaluated according to the following
rubric:
